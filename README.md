# SPADemo
This is a single page application (SPA) of a company management system for its admin, manager, and the standard employees. Here admin can perform all kinds of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, & Delete) actions and the manager is responsible for handling the employee's tasks. So basically this is a simple dashboard, but the main important factor of this project is, it doesn't refresh the whole page for each request. The Vue-Router makes this webpage like a standalone application, which is obvious for a very large organization.
